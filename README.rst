NOTE: This is my fork of Yuvraj's code which is hosted here:
        
      http://code.google.com/p/qgvdial/
      
      It's likely that the two branches will be out of sync, so 
      please check the above link. This fork is mostly for me to
      play with some Harmattan specific code for my N9
